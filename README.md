# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification Model

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **machine learning classification model** to predict the species of an Iris flower based on its physical features.  
The model is trained using the famous **Iris dataset**, which is widely used for beginners to understand supervised learning.

The model classifies flowers into:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The Iris dataset contains **150 samples** with the following features:

| Feature | Description |
|-------|------------|
| Sepal Length | Length of the sepal (cm) |
| Sepal Width | Width of the sepal (cm) |
| Petal Length | Length of the petal (cm) |
| Petal Width | Width of the petal (cm) |

**Target Variable:**  
- Flower Species (3 classes)
